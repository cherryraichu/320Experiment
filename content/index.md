# *CMSC320 - Publishing your Final Project to the Web!*

Congratulations on finishing your CMSC320 final project. In this article, we're going to walk you through the very last step of your project...publication to the internet!


GitHub is a free provider of internet hosting for software development projects and version control of project files. They provide a service called <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a> that provides website hosting backed by a GitHub-based git repository. We would like you to host your final project on a GitHub Pages project site.


# Tutorial

1. Download your Google Colab file and convert it from a file with a .ipynb extention to a .html file
* Make sure you download the .ipynb file after running the code within your cells so that it contains the output of your code.
* This <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Mostafa-MR/Convert_ipynb_to_HTML_in_Colab/blob/main/Convert_ipynb_to_HTML_in_Colab.ipynb">link</a> is a online resource that can be used for converting files from .ipynb to .html format


2. Create a Github repository for your project and title it *username.github.io*. 

* <b>Make sure username is the same as whatever you chose for your global GitHub account.</b>


3. Add the following files to your repository: 
    1. iPython Notebook  -> This should be the file with the .ipynb file extention
    2. HTML 


4. Now we're ready to host. Go to your repository settings





Check if your website works and is formatted correctly by visiting *username.github.io* in your internet browser

The deliverable to the CMSC320 staff will then be a
single URL pointing to this publicly-hosted GitHub Pages-backed website.
